          <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! I'm Feryel, an algerian student at Vistula University in Warsaw. I'm a passionate and curious individual who thrives at the intersection of technology and creativity. With a strong love for both engineering and art, I've always been drawn to projects where I can blend logic with imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coding allows me to bring complex systems to life, while art and storytelling let me express ideas in vivid and personal ways. This is exactly why I'm so passionate about game development—it’s the perfect medium to combine programming, visual design, and narrative into a single, expressive experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it's designing characters, building interactive stories, or solving technical challenges, I’m always excited to explore how creativity and code can come together to create something meaningful.
            </p>
